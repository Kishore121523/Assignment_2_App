# This app contains a Menu with two actions right in the action bar of the app ( Enter Details and View Details). 
## Those actions were made as a fragment and it dynamically replaces the FrameLayout in MainActivity
## Action 1: Getting user details - This is made as a fragment in which the user can enter their basic details. Different type of views were used in this (radio, spinner, button and editText).
## Action 2: Displaying the user details - The user details entered in the first action fragment is passed using putExtra and displayed using this action. This action is also made as a seperate fragment.

## Hence, A working MENU that switches TWO ACTIONS, and each action uses its own FRAGMENT (2 normal Fragment and a Dialog Fragment were used). Several VIEWS (radio, spinner, button and editText) were also used in this app
